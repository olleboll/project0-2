### Break 24 september 2020

I've made a lot of progress.

The current setup is supposed to be the starting area. With quests... 
The quests turned out really hacky but it works. Hopefully I know some more about unity and c# when I decide to return to this.

#### Other implementations

The medallion funtionality which is attached to the UI prefab works faily well. Still some hardcoding there that don't make sense.
Hopefully I know more about how to implement that when I return.
