### Break 24 september 2020

I've made a lot of progress.

The current setup is supposed to be the starting area. With quests... 
The quests turned out really hacky but it works. Hopefully I know some more about unity and c# when I decide to return to this.

#### Other implementations

The medallion funtionality which is attached to the UI prefab works faily well. Still some hardcoding there that don't make sense.
Hopefully I know more about how to implement that when I return.

Enemies can do a bunch of stuff. Currently have like 4 or 5 enemies including a "boss" who can do multiple different attacks.

What was a pain doing this was doing animations for top-down characters.. Don't seem it's really how unity is supposed to be working..
