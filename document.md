#### Prologue

The order found the power of the artifact and made them into medallions. Among rules they set up they decide that no one may interact with their counterparts, if there are any.

Some dude is thinking f that and feel he is entitled to be the only one of himself. He may also think that this somehow will make him stronger. He kills most of the order and takes off on a rampage across universes to kill everyone who is him in other universes.

#### Part 1

<protagonist> lives in some universe with "realistic" setting but medieval. Starts in a village which seems very friendly (idyll). The people in the village are very content with their life and it has the culture of not wanting to go anywhere else. Why go to other places when everything is so nice here (Like the Shire! They are basically hobbits!). The <protagonist> goes out hunting with sword, which he can throw. Chases some elk and falls down into a dungeon. Has to do some puzzles (tutorial) and fight snakes and mice or other small monsters. Player learns to swing sword, activate objects and "switches". Eventually comes into a room with no exit and no way back. A body is on the ground. An old man, seems to have bled to death. A radiating artifact next to it. On pickup the <protagonist> is instantly teleported.

After teleportation everything looks almost the same. The body is gone and maybe some other details are different. There is a way out now. Exiting leads to a forest also very similar to one the <protagonist> was hunting in with minor differences. The animals are different and more hostile. Coming back to where the village should be, there is no village. Instead some scary monsters who are about to eat a fairy. He kills the monsters and saves the fairy who becomes his companion. She gives the <protagonist> some ability/abilities (TBD. Maybe this is when the player learns throw?). She tells him that he looks like someone else she saw before she got caught. She takes him to where she saw this man vanish in thin air. Once there the medallion glows and the player learns how to use it. There is one place to go. The Order headquarters.

At The Order hq there is one old man who tells <protagonist> more of what's going on. What the medallion he picked up is and that someone of the order killed everyone and took off to wreak havoc upon the multiverse.

#### Part 2

At this point the main objective for the <protagonist> is to go home. As he is basically lost and does not know what's going on. He does not really care about the evil guy killing shit since it will obviously not affect him.

He gets sent in a direction in order to make it back which makes him go through more worlds and learn about the diversity of the worlds.

Finally back at his world and his forest has burnt. Someone who means alot to him is still alive and tells him the person who responsible for burning the village this was looking for him, then he dies. (maybe not everyone is dead? Just burnt the village down which is enough for him to feel he needs to stop him).

The <protagonist> decides he needs to go back to the order and fix this. The fairy is happy to help, this is way more interesting than her every day life.

CURRENT:

saker jag vet måste fixas.

1. tilemapsen måste fixas i alla scener!
2. Borde även skriva om hur andra grejer rör sig. Kanske testa att göra de till dynamic också?

- Detaljerade världar.. kan delas in i små.. så länge nån slags karta upphålls. Alltså de måste sitta ihop på nått sätt.
- Snabb combat. Mycket fiender, hack and slash. Snabb vanlig attack (gärna med nån combo så mer än bara 1 likadant slag) och några lång cooldown attacker som man låser upp/hittar. Kasta svärdet.


idér till pussel:
- Slå/skjuta flera "switchar" för att öppna "dörr". I flera olika världar. (enkelt liksom)
- Slå/kasta på flera grejer inom en viss tid
- kasta i en linje för att få alla i tid
- Switchar som rör sig och måste träffas "samtidigt"
- i princip tatta från god of war.


combat:
- Vanlig attack men också feta med lång cooldown?
